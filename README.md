# JavaScript on the Web

## Context

I need to develop a TODO app. I get a little bit excited and ended doing more than the requirements.

## View

Let's check this wonderful piece of software [here.](https://pelafustan.github.io/js_in_web-challenge_05/)

## TODO

* Change color depending on status.
* Block other options when task is marked as completed or cancelled.
* I'm quite sure that I'm forgetting somethig, but maybe it isn't important.
